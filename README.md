Motivation: 
Neural network technologies can be beneficial in finding innovative solutions to real-world business challenges, especially those involving complex data. Gesture recognition for human-computer interaction entails the use of algorithms and sensors to interpret human gestures as commands. This technology enables users to interact with computers or devices without physical touch, utilizing movements of the hands, fingers, or even the entire body. It has been applied in various fields such as gaming, virtual reality, robotics, and assistive technology for the disabled, thereby enhancing the intuitiveness and accessibility of device control. Neural networks in Gesture Recognition for Human-Computer Interaction can further enhance technology and propel it to a higher level.
